# tracking-objects-using-APIs
# here i am using various tracking APIs in python to track the objects like face, ball etc
# there are a total of 5 different API options to choose from, select any API and start tracking using your webcam
# the first popup window will click an image that appears on the webcame, you need to draw or select a region around the object which you intend to track
# the second popup window will demnstrate the tracking
# you need to install the opencv library in your IDE (anaconda,pycharm etc)
